```shell
git clone https://github.com/ethanhawksley/hawksley.dev
cd hawksley.dev
pnpm install
pnpm run dev

## Subset Fonts

The site uses a subsetted version of the IBM Plex Sans and Mono fonts for increased performance. These are both available for download on Google Fonts.

To subset:

- Install fonttools
  - `sudo dnf install fonttools`
  - `sudo apt install fonttools`
- Download ibm-plex-sans.ttf and ibm-plex-mono.ttf from Google Fonts
- Place both in the project root
- Run `bash scripts/subset-fonts.sh`
- Generated fonts will be placed in `public/fonts`

## Generate Derivative Images

The site uses many derivates of the `src/assets/ethan-hawksley.png` photo. It is transcoded and compressed to various other formats and sizes.

To generate them:

- Install ImageMagick and libavif-tools
  - `sudo dnf install libavif-tools libwebp-tools ImageMagick`
  - `sudo apt install libavif-bin webp imagemagick`
- You will also need to install `cjpegli`, which may require building `jpegli` from source
- Run `bash scripts/generate-assets.sh`
- Derivative assets will be placed within `public` and `src/assets`
